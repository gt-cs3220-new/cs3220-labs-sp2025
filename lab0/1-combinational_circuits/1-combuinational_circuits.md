# Lab 0 - Combinational Circuits

1. Create an customized chip with four AND gates and two OR gates. 
2. Circuit diagram of the customized chip:

3. Create a module with the same functionality as the chip shown above. It has 10 inputs and 2 outputs. You may choose to use an `assign` statement to drive each of the output wires, or you may choose to declare (four) wires for use as intermediate signals, where each internal wire is driven by the output of one of the AND gates. For extra practice, try it both ways.
